<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Cooking whole oats doesn't have to take all morning. A simple overnight soak speeds up the process considerably and treating the cooking liquid like a 
    pan sauce ensures that the oats are thickened to your desired consistency. The most difficult part is deciding what flavor profile to choose!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>50 grams steel cut or whole oats</li>
    <li>dried or fresh fruit (optional)</li>
    <li>nuts (optional)</li>
    <li>citrus juice (optional)</li>
    <li>sweetener such as honey, sugar or syrup (optional)</li>
    <li>spices (optional)</li>
    <li>any dairy or dairy substitute product (optional)</li>
    
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Allow the oats to soak in water at least 6 hours prior to cooking. If you're using any large dry fruits or whole spices, add them to now to speed up the cooking process.</li>
    <li>Bring the soaked oats/dry fruits/spices and soaking water to a light simmer in a non-stick pan.</li>
    <li>Simmer the oats/fruits/spices to your desired doneness, adding additional water to the pan as needed to aid in cooking. Any fresh fruits (e.g. diced apple) which you'd like to soften can be added during this step.</li>
    <li>Once the oats and fruits are cooked to your liking, reduce the cooking liquid until it has almost completely evaporated.</li>
    <li>Adjust the consistency of the oats by adding your dairy product or water. The quantity of dairy added can be reduced with additional simmering.</li>
    <li>Mix in any dried/fresh fruits, nuts, ground spices as desired.</li>
    <li>Season with sweetner, citrus juice and salt.</li>
    <li>Garnish with additional fruits, nuts, spices, sweetener and/or dairy.</li>
</ol>
