<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Rice is a simple yet easy to "mess-up" dish. Knowing more about your 
    specific variety of rice fixes that problem and ensure that it 
    comes out perfectly done everytime!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>200 grams (1 cup) jasmine rice</li>
    <li>275 grams (1.2 cups) water</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Optional step to reduce clumping (i.e. prevent the grains from sticking to themselves as much): Place the rice in a fine mesh sieve and pass the sieve under running water. Move the seive around to ensure that all grains of rice are washed. Allow the rice to drain well.</li>
    <li>Bring the rice, water and salt to a boil in a lidded non-stick vessel</li>
    <li>Once a boil is reached, reduce the heat to low and allow the rice to cook for ten minutes.</li>
    <li>After the rice has cooked for ten minutes, remove it from the heat source and allow to sit for another ten minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the lid from the vessel and gently fluff the rice in the pot or another bowl. This will allow the rice to cool more quickly and help prevent the grains from sticking to themselves.</li>
</ol>
